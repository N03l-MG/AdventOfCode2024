## Advent of Code 2024 (In C#)

This is my second year participating in AoC. I chose to once again program in C# (I think it is underrated). I did at least part one in most days this year. Big shout-out to [HyperNeutrino](https://www.youtube.com/@hyper-neutrino) for her fantastic tutorials on YouTube. Great resource on days in which I was lost!
